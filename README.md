1. Class Definition:

The code defines a Python class called PromptManager.
This class acts as a tool for managing and validating prompts used for interacting with large language models (LLMs).
 2. Initialization:

When a PromptManager object is created, it's initialized with a list of allowed prompts.
These prompts serve as a baseline for determining which prompts are acceptable for use with the LLM.
 3. Methods:

validate_prompt(self, prompt): Checks if a given prompt is present within the list of allowed prompts. Returns True if valid, False otherwise.
add_prompt(self, prompt): Adds a new prompt to the list of allowed prompts, ensuring it's not already present.
remove_prompt(self, prompt): Removes a specified prompt from the list of allowed prompts.
list_prompts(self): Returns a list of all currently allowed prompts.
 4. Usage Example:

The code demonstrates how to create a PromptManager object, add a new prompt, validate prompts, list prompts, and remove a prompt.
 5. Purpose:

This code's primary purpose is to create a mechanism for controlling and restricting the prompts that can be sent to an LLM.
This is often used as a safety measure to prevent unintended or harmful interactions with the model.
It's designed to be integrated within a website or application to provide user-friendly prompt management.
